        "[Grounding in Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/ground-gemini) lets you use generative text models to generate content grounded in your own documents and data. This capability lets the model access information at runtime that goes beyond its training data. By grounding model responses in Google Search results or data stores within [Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/enterprise-search-introduction), LLMs that are grounded in data can produce more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant responses.\n",

Even outside this path, a partial solar eclipse will be visible across a much larger area of the United States, including most of the western and southwestern states.\n*   **Important Safety Note:** **Never look directly at the Sun during a solar eclipse without proper eye protection!** Use ISO-certified solar viewing glasses or a handheld solar viewer. Regular sunglasses are *not* safe.\n\n**But wait! There's an even bigger one coming up soon after:**\n\n**The next *total* solar eclipse visible in the United States will be on April 8, 2024.**\n\n*   **Type:** Total Solar Eclipse. This is the \"big one,\" where the Moon completely blocks the Sun, turning day into twilight for a few precious minutes.\n*   **Path:** The path of totality will stretch from Texas, through the Midwest, and into the Northeast. Major cities that are potentially along the path of totality include Dallas, Indianapolis, Cleveland, and Buffalo.\n*   **Importance:** Total solar eclipses are rare and spectacular events. They are a fantastic opportunity for scientific observation, as well as a breathtaking experience for everyone who witnesses them.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n*   **October 14, 2023: Annular Solar Eclipse (ring of fire), primarily visible in the western and southwestern US.**\n*   **April 8, 2024: Total Solar Eclipse, crossing a path from Texas to the Northeast US.**\n\nStart planning now if you want to witness either of these eclipses! Hotel rooms and viewing spots along the path of totality tend to fill up well in advance.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with regarding solar eclipses or astronomy?\n"

Be open-minded\\nOne of the most important things you can do to be a productive member of an inclusive and diverse workforce is\\nto be open-minded. This means being willing to learn about different cultures and perspectives, and being willing\\nto change your own views when necessary. It also means being respectful of others, even if you disagree with\\nthem. 2. Be respectful\\nRespect is essential for any productive workplace, but it is especially important in an inclusive and diverse\\nworkforce. This means being respectful of other people's cultures, religions, and sexual orientations. It also means\\nbeing respectful of other people's opinions, even if you disagree with them. 3. Be inclusive\\nInclusion is another important part of being a productive member of an inclusive and diverse workforce. This\\nmeans making sure that everyone feels welcome and included, regardless of their background or identity. It also\\nmeans making sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate and contribute. 4. Be diverse\\nDiversity is a strength, not a weakness. This means embracing different perspectives and experiences, and using\\nthem to create a more innovative and successful workplace. It also means being willing to challenge your own\\nbiases and assumptions. \\n...\\nCelebrate the diversity of your workplace and\\nthe contributions of all employees. \\n...\\n5. Be yourself\\nFinally, it is important to be yourself in an inclusive and diverse workforce. This means being honest about who you\\nare and what you believe in. It also means being comfortable with your own identity and being proud of who you are. Following these tips will help you to be a productive member of an inclusive and diverse workforce. By being\\nopen-minded, respectful, inclusive, diverse, and yourself, you can help to create a more positive and productive\\nworkplace for everyone. Here are some additional tips for working in an inclusive and diverse environment: Be aware of your own biases. We all have biases, whether we are aware of them or not. It is important to be\\naware of your own biases so that you can work to overcome them. Be open to feedback. If you are working in an inclusive and diverse environment, it is important to be open\\nto feedback. This will help you to learn and grow. Be willing to change. Change is inevitable, especially in an inclusive and diverse environment. Be willing to\\nchange your own views and behaviors when necessary. Be patient. It takes time to build trust and understanding in an inclusive and diverse environment. Be\\npatient with yourself and with others. Celebrate diversity. Diversity is a strength, not a weakness. \", title='Cymbal Bank Company Culture', uri='gs://cloud-samples-data/gen-app-builder/search/cymbal-bank-employee/Cymbal Bank Company Culture.pdf') web=None\n",

However, I can provide a more detailed breakdown of the general steps involved:\n\nOkay, let's break down business travel booking in more detail:\n\n**1. Understanding & Adhering to Company Policy:**\n\n*   **Locate the Policy:** Your company's travel policy is your bible. It dictates what you can and cannot do. Look for it on your company intranet, HR portal, or ask your manager.\n*   **Key Elements:** Pay close attention to:\n    *   **Approved Vendors:** Many companies have negotiated rates with specific airlines, hotels, and rental car companies. You may be required to use these.\n    *   **Spending Limits:** Understand the per diem for meals, maximum hotel rates, and any restrictions on class of travel (e.g., economy vs. business class for flights).\n    *   **Approval Processes:** Know when you need pre-approval for travel, and who needs to approve it.\n    *   **Expense Reporting Requirements:** Understand what receipts are required, which forms to use, and the deadline for submitting expenses.\n\n**2. Using Company Travel Tools/Agencies:**\n\n*   **Mandatory Platforms:** Many companies require you to use a specific online booking tool or a designated travel agency. This helps them track travel spend, enforce policy, and often get better rates.\n*   **Familiarize Yourself:** If your company uses a tool like \"Cymbal Fly\" (for flights), \"Cymbal Stay\" (for hotels), or \"Cymbal Drive\" (for rental cars) take the time to learn how to use them effectively.\n*   **Agency Support:** If using a travel agency, understand their contact information and hours of operation. They can assist with complex itineraries, last-minute changes, and travel emergencies.\n\n**3. Booking Flights:**\n\n*   **Search Effectively:** When using a booking tool, enter your destination, dates, and preferred times. Be flexible with your dates if possible, as prices can vary significantly.\n*   **Consider Connecting Flights:** Non-stop flights are convenient but often more expensive. Consider connecting flights if it saves the company money.\n*   **Airline Preferences:** If your company policy allows, stick to airlines where you have frequent flyer status.\n*   **Review Baggage Fees:** Factor in baggage fees when comparing flight costs.\n*   **Seat Selection:** Choose your seat in advance, if possible.\n\n**4. Booking Hotels:**\n\n*   **Location, Location, Location:** Select a hotel that's conveniently located near your meeting location or client site.\n*   **Read Reviews:** Check online reviews to get an idea of the hotel's quality and service.\n*   **Amenities:** Consider amenities like free Wi-Fi, breakfast, and a gym.\n*   **Corporate Rates:** Always check if your company has a negotiated rate with the hotel.\n\n**5. Booking Rental Cars:**\n\n*   **Car Size:** Choose a car size that's appropriate for your needs. A compact car is usually sufficient for one person, while a larger car may be necessary for multiple passengers or luggage.\n*   **Insurance:** Understand your company's policy on rental car insurance. You may already be covered by your corporate insurance policy.\n*   **Location:** Pick up and drop off the car at the most convenient location.\n*   **Check for Damage:** Before driving off, carefully inspect the car for any existing damage and document it.\n\n**6. Expense Reporting & Reimbursement:**\n\n*   **Track Expenses Diligently:** Keep all receipts for eligible expenses, such as flights, hotels, meals, transportation, and business-related entertainment.\n*   **Use Company Expense Tool:** Familiarize yourself with your company's expense reporting tool (e.g., \"Cymbal Expense\").\n*   **Submit on Time:** Submit your expense report promptly to ensure timely reimbursement.\n*   **Policy Compliance:** Ensure all expenses comply with your company's travel policy.\n\n**7. Travel Advances:**\n\n*   **When to Request:** If you anticipate significant out-of-pocket expenses, request a travel advance well in advance of your trip.\n*   **Follow Procedure:** Follow your company's procedure for requesting advances.\n\n**8. Duty of Care:**\n\n*   **Company Responsibility:** Many companies have a \"duty of care\" to ensure the safety and well-being of their employees while traveling.\n*   **Emergency Contacts:** Provide your company with your emergency contact information.\n*   **Travel Alerts:** Be aware of any travel advisories or alerts for your destination.\n"
